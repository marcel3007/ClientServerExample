# TCP Client - Server - Example
Client can request weather informations from a server to a given date.

Client sends the date (e.g. 2018-12-06) to the server and the server sends the minimal, maximal, average and all hourly values for the day.

The result is printed on the console.

The weather data comes from CSV file.
